# Human activity recognition

Program developed for the master thesis **Human Activity Recognition On Sequences Of Digital Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks**.

The proposed method of human action recognition uses both spacial and temporal features. First the algorithm extracts Optical Flow and Difference of Gaussian and then combines it with standard grey images for the purpose of input and training of the Neural Network. The focus is put on creating less complex system for easier preparation and implementation in real life applications. KTH dataset is used as experimental database. Later tests are performed on impact the amount of training data for training Neural Network and batch size. The proposed method achieves accuracy of 85.5% and takes significantly less effort to implement than other popular techniques.
